I am a lifelong Arsenal supporter and have always wanted to create an outlet that combines my passions for soccer, analytics, graphics, and the Arsenal. I have full intentions of publishing match previews/analysis, player ratings, interesting analytics, and match simulations to this blog. However, for now, posts will be at the mercy of my free time and will cover topics I find interesting related to the Arsenal.
